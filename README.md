# PyBricks-Train-Motor-Control-Script

This script allows you to control Lego Trains via PyBricks without using the official Powered Up App.

Origionally, this was a modification of a script Lok24 designed, but was incompatible with the latest version of PyBricks (v3.2.x). I updated the script to work with modern versions of PyBricks.

Since then, Lok24 has provided his own updated version of the script with modern PyBricks support, and I have replaced my changes with his.
